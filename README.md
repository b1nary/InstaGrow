# Project dead. Instagram does barely allow anything with their API anymore. Good luck getting out of Sandbox mode. Fuck you Instagram, why do you take away all the fun?

# InstaGrow

Grow your Instagram audience naturally with real followers. Automated. Easy.

### Disclaimer

The Bot is still in development, while parts of it work like intended it is not yet fully done and does not bring all the mentioned functionality. I got shadow-banned on Instagram while working on it, now waiting for the ban to dissolve.

### Story time

Lets get this straight, i am no instagram user by any means. To be more specific i dont get the platform at all and i'll show you why. Instagram _works_ by people posting images, following other people and like/comment images. To my surprise the platform is heavily bound on mobile phones and nether the api nor the web interface are able to upload pictures. Only your phone.

I must admit that this really should prevent most of the options to spam. But this product is not for spam, the purpose is a little different. To make it short, it got created to show that actual human interaction is not worth it and you can fully automate yourself to a typical _famous_ Instagram account because people on instagram work like bots themself.

For me personaly its a bet with a person that often doesnt forget to mention _how many instagram follower_ she got. This is here to prove that a few lines of code can do better than any human, not important how sexy your photos are.

### Functions

Not all functions are build in yet, those missing are working only partially are striked trough.

* Following users by tag
* Like images by tag
* Make sure to do both in a efficient way
* Max out api limits
* Use multiple apis at once (Limits work per API key)
* ~~Follow back automatically~~
* ~~Auto unfollow people who dont follow you after N days~~

### What it is not

If you are into marketing this Bot is just half of the Boat. There is no way to automate posting and comments. All it does is growing your followership by following.

### Changelog

* **0.1** Release it to Github.
